	<h1> The new revolution in Sudan </h1>

<div class="summary">
	<h3> <p> When Sudan’s Ismail Azhari was sworn into office in 1954 as the nation’s first Prime Minister, he led his country into independence two years later while facing a series of key challenges. Before the end of 1956, he was removed from office having been incapable of reconciling political differences or resolving constitutional issues. </p></h3>

Azhari also faced disputes within his own party about the framework of government. He preferred a prime ministerial style while others wanted a presidential system. The differences led to a breakaway by some members of the Khatmiyah sect unhappy about the direction that he took. Today, the prime ministerial issue has again taken centre stage. Under the National Dialogue process, participants from opposition groups insisted that the country should return to a system of prime ministerial rule. However, despite the appointment of Hassan Bakri Saleh – an erstwhile colleague and friend of the president – to the new position created by the constitution, and despite relinquishing 30 per cent of the legislative assembly and cabinet to the opposition, the President continues to hold the reins of power.

In 2018, the big question is whether President Al-Bashir should stand for a third term when the elections come along in two years’ time. There are already disagreements about this starting to appear in the ranks of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and the Islamic Movement. Al-Bashir still seems to enjoy a high approval rating, and various civil society organisations, large sections of the Islamic movement and religious groups have already backed his candidature.
